Pong is a classic electronic sports (eSports) video game that simulates a table tennis or ping-pong match. It was one of the earliest arcade video games and was released in 1972 by Atari, one of the pioneers in the video game industry. Pong is often considered one of the first commercially successful video games and played a significant role in establishing video gaming as a form of entertainment.

In Pong, two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, and their objective is to hit a ball back and forth, preventing it from passing their paddle and scoring points when the opponent misses the ball. The game is played on a simple 2D graphical interface with two paddles, a ball, and a simple scoring system.

Pong became extremely popular and laid the foundation for many other video games that followed. Its simplicity and competitive gameplay made it a social phenomenon, attracting players to arcades and helping to establish the video game industry as a viable business. Over the years, Pong has been remade, adapted, and referenced in numerous forms, becoming an iconic symbol of early video gaming history.
